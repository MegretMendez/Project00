Step 1: Creating a Cube

Description: On the top of your screen select the "GameObject" option, then select "3D Object" and lastly click on "Cube". Your cube should be created, as shown in the picture below.

Step 2: Modify our new cube to fit the criteria of a wall

Description: On the top left corner of your editing screen you will see a vertical menu. These are your tools. Each individual tool has a specific action. These actions are helpful for editing the scale,position, and angles of rotation of our cube. For this step we will use the "scale" tool(circled in red) which is useful for modifying the length,width and volume of
our cube.

Step 3: Creating two more walls

Description: To speed up the process of creating and editing two new cubes, we will duplicate the original cube. We will do such thing by right-clicking the name of our original cube(in this case Cube). On the left panel of our screen, right click on the name of our original cube(Cube) and then select "Duplicate". Repeat this process twice and you should have two new cubes.

Step 4: Moving new cubes to form 3 walls

Description: In this step, we willl use the "Move" tool. This tool appears in the Tools menu used in Step 2. This tool allows us to slide an object in three directions(foward/back,side-to-side,up/down). We will use this tool to move the two new copies of our first cube to form a square with an opening on the front, which is where our door will be.

Step 5: Creating the front wall with a door hole

Description: Lets create a new cube, modify it, and align it on one of the corners of the front of our house.

Description: Lets duplicate the cube we just created and edited, and place it on the other side of the front of the house.

Step 6: Create a new cube to enclose the front wall

Description: Create a new cube and enhance it so it is large and thin. After editing the new cube, position it at the top of the front wall,using the "scale" and "move" tools. The purpose of this step is that the door is not the same height as the front wall.

Step 7: Create Roof

Description: In this last step we will add a roof to our house. We will do this by creating one cube, modify it using the "scale" tool to our desired measures.

Description: Using the "Rotate" tool(third option in the tool menu), rotate the wall we created to an angle, such that it appears to be a side of the roof.

Description: Repeat the process on the other side and connect the top of the walls, so it looks like a single roof. 

Lastly make some finishing touches around your cubes and done!

As our first group exercise creating a house, the functionalities of how you can move objects around and re-arrange them was incredibly tedious at first, nonetheless, after trial and error the movements became second nature. Creating a heavy satisfaction after every arrangement, the house came to life in a pleasant way. Through this first experience, we as a group learned that understanding the practicality of the tools was a necessity. As a result, we are more eager than ever to continue creating and developing projects.
